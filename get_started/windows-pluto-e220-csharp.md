# Step 1: Prerequisites

You should have the following items ready before beginning the process:

-   Computer with Git client installed and access to the
    [azure-iot-sdk-csharp](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-csharp) GitHub
    public repository.
-   Required hardware:
	-   [Pluto E220](http://client.mitac.com/products-Embedded-Box-PC-PlutoE220.html)
	-   USB keyboard
	-   USB mouse
	-   HDMI or DVI cable
	-   TV/Monitor that support HDMI or DVI
-   Download and install [DeviceExplorer](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-csharp/releases).
-   [Set up your IoT hub](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-device-ecosystem/blob/master/setup_iothub.md).

#### Create a device on IoT Hub
-   With your IoT hub configured and running in Azure, follow the instructions in **"Create Device"** section of [DeviceExplorer Usage document](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-csharp/blob/master/tools/DeviceExplorer/readme.md).

#### Write down device credentials
-   Make note of the Connection String for your device by following the instructions in **"Get device connection string or configuration data"** section of [DeviceExplorer Usage document](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-csharp/blob/master/tools/DeviceExplorer/readme.md).

# Step 2: Prepare your Device

1.  Power on [Pluto E220](http://client.mitac.com/products-Embedded-Box-PC-PlutoE220.html).

2.  Connect [Pluto E220](http://client.mitac.com/products-Embedded-Box-PC-PlutoE220.html) to your network by using ethernet cable or by using Wireless router.

2.  Install Visual Studio 2015 and Tools. 

    To run the csharp sample , you will need to install [Visual Studio 2015](https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/products/vs-2015-product-editions.aspx). You can install any edition of Visual Studio, including the free Community edition.

    Make sure to select the **Universal Windows App Development Tools**, the component required for writing apps Windows 10:

# Step 3: Build and Run the sample

-   Download the [Azure IoT SDK](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-csharp) and the sample programs and save them to your local repository.
-   Start a new instance of Visual Studio 2015.
-   Open the **iothub_csharp_deviceclient.sln** solution in the `csharp\device` folder in your local copy of the repository.
-   In Visual Studio, from Solution Explorer, navigate to the **samples** folder.
-   In the **DeviceClientAmqpSample** project, open the ***Program.cs*** file.
-   Locate the following code in the file:

        private const string DeviceConnectionString = "<replace>";
        
-   Replace `<replace>` with the connection string for your device.
-   In **Solution Explorer**, right-click the **DeviceClientAmqpSample** project, click **Debug**, and then click **Start new instance** to build and run the sample. The console displays messages as the application sends device-to-cloud messages to IoT Hub.
-   Use the **DeviceExplorer** utility to observe the messages IoT Hub receives from the **Device Client AMQP Sample** application.
-   Refer "Monitor device-to-cloud events" in [DeviceExplorer Usage document](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-csharp/blob/master/tools/DeviceExplorer/readme.md) to see the data your device is sending.
-   Refer "Send cloud-to-device messages" in [DeviceExplorer Usage document](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-csharp/blob/master/tools/DeviceExplorer/readme.md) for instructions on sending messages to device.
